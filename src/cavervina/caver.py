"""
Lightweight helpers for working with CAVER 3 outputs.

This module documents expected inputs but does not execute CAVER itself.

Expected outputs after running CAVER 3 on a receptor:
- A set of tunnel centerlines with discs: a text/CSV file with columns
  x,y,z,radius[,nx,ny,nz] along the path from protein interior to surface.

Typical command (example; adjust paths/options):
  java -jar Caver.jar \
    -p receptor.pdb \
    -c config.txt \
    -o caver_output

Then export a specific tunnelâ€™s centerline to a CSV for this tool.
